;
; Given a graph and a strongly connected component in it, we're interested in
; finding cycles in that graph which satisfy certain properties. For instance,
; we might want to restrict ourselves to only ww or wr edges (for G1c), or
; find a cycle in which every rw edge is *not* adjacent to another rw edge.
; (for G2-nonadjacent). Enumeration of all paths and filtering them for these
; criteria after the fact may be hugely expensive. Instead, we push the
; filtering process into the enumeration process, making sure that we only
; explore paths which would satisfy the target cycle requirements.
;
; To do this, we define a PathState as a sequence of adjacent vertices in the
; graph, *plus* an arbitrary state. As a part of our search, we take a state
; machine transition function (f state path edge-value vertex), which evaluates
; whether we can append that vertex to the given path. A search for G-single
; could say, for instance "this state tells me we already saw a rw edge, so we
; can't add another to this particular path.
;
; f returns a new state if it is possible to extend the path to that vertex, or
; ::invalid if it is not possible.
