  In general, the differences between orders fall into some cases:

  1. One empty

     We simply pick the non-empty order.

  2. Same first element

     Our order is [2] followed by the merged result of [x y] and [z].

  3. Different first elements followed by a common element

    We drop the smaller element and recur with [3 y] [3]. This isn't... exactly
  symmetric; we prefer longer and higher elements for tail-end conflicts, but I

(defn graph
  "Some parts of a transaction's dependency graph--for instance,
  anti-dependency cycles--involve the *version order* of states for a key.
  Given two transactions: [[:w :x 1]] and [[:w :x 2]], we can't tell whether T1
  or T2 happened first. This makes it hard to identify read-write and
  write-write edges, because we can't tell what particular transaction should
  have overwritten the state observed by a previous transaction.

  However, if we constrain ourselves to transactions whose only mutation is to
  *append* a value to a key's current state...

    {:f :txn, :value [[:r :x [1 2]] [:append :x 3] [:r :x [1 2 3]]]} ...

  ... we can derive the version order for (almost) any pair of operations on
  the same key because the order of appends is encoded in every read: if we
  observe [:r :x [3 1 2]], we know the previous states must have been [3] [3 1]
  [3 1 2].

  That is, assuming appends actually work correctly. If the database loses
  appends or reorders them, it's *likely* (but not necessarily the case), that
  we'll observe states like:

    [1 2 3]
    [1 3 4]  ; 2 has been lost!

  We can verify these in a single O(appends^2) pass by sorting all observed
  states for a key by size, and verifying that each is a prefix of the next.
  Assuming we *do* observe a total order, we can use the longest read value for
  each key as an order over appends for that key. This order is *almost*
  complete in that appends which are never read can't be related, but so long
  as the DB lets us see most of our appends at least once, this should work.

  So then, our strategy here is to compute those orders for each key, then use
  them to relate successive [w w], [r w], and [w r] pair on that key. [w,w]
  pairs are a direct write dependency, [w,r] pairs are a direct
  read-dependency, and [r,w] pairs are direct anti-dependencies.

  Definitions', page 8."
