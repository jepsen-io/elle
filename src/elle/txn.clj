(defn lost-update-cases
  "Takes a function write? which returns true iff an operation is a write, and
  a history. Returns a seq of error maps describing any lost updates found.
  Assumes writes are unique. Each map is of the form:

    {:key   The key in common
     :value The value read by all transactions
     :txns  A collection of completion ops for transactions which collided on
            this key and value.}

  Lost Update is a bit of a weird beast. I don't actually *have* a general
  definition of it: even in Adya, it's defined as 'Histories which look like
  H_lu', where H_lu is:

    w0(x0)
           r1(x0, 10)                          w1(x1, 14) c1
                      r2(x0, 10) w2(x2, 15) c2

    [x0 << x2 << x1]

  It stands to reason that the version order x2 << x1 and the precise order of
  T1 and T2 isn't necessary here: the essential problem is that T1 and T2 both
  read x0 and wrote different values of x, presumably based on x0. If this ever
  happens it could lead to the loss of the logical update T1 or T2 is
  performing.

  In cyclic terms, this must manifest as write-read edges from some transaction
  T0 to both T1 and T2 on the same key, (since both must read T0's write of x).

    +--wr--> T1
    |
    T0
    |
    +--wr--> T2

  WLOG, let x1 << x2. If we have the complete version order for x, we must also
  have a write-write edge from T1 -> T2 since both wrote x. However, since T2
  observed the state x0 which was overwritten by T1, we also have an rw edge
  from T2->T1. This forms a G2-item cycle:

    +--wr--> T1 <-+
    |        |    |
    T0       ww   rw
    |        V    |
    +--wr--> T2 --+

  We can already detect G2-item. However, we may not detect some instances of
  lost update because we may be missing some of these edges. Our version order
  inference is conservative, and especially for rw-registers may fail to
  capture many edges between versions. Even for list-append, if one of the
  writes is never read that version won't show up in the version order at all.

  What actually *matters* here is that two transactions read the same x0 and
  both wrote x, and committed. The precise order of writes to x doesn't matter.
  We can detect this directly, in linear time and space, by scanning the set of
  committed transactions and looking for any pair which both read some x=x0 and
  write x."
